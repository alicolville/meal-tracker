Rick Feedback:

- When adding a new "Meal" auto add it to entry and close dialog. Add another checkbox that adds meal to DB, then to entry, and then closes?


TODO:

- Based on Rick's slow site, add some optimisation.
- Add a hook to delete all entries when a user is deleted
- check user's can only edit entries and data belonging to those entries that are theirs
- If no existing meals then hide
