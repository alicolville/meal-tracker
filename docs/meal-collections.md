# Meal Collections

> The following feature is only available in the [Premium]({{ site.baseurl }}/upgrade.html) version of the plugin.

Besides users having their own meal collections, the [Premium]({{ site.baseurl }}/upgrade.html) version comes will the ability to add a site-wide meal collection. Administrators of your site can build up a library of meals that all of your users can search. This library will compliment the user's own collection of meals when searching for meals to add against their entries.

### How to setup

- Via the WordPress Admin menu, navigate to "Meal Tracker" > "Meal Collection".
- Add one or more meals by clicking the "Add a new meal" button and completing the subsequent form.
- My default, the admin meal collection isn't searchable. To allow your users to search it, you must enabled it via the settings page. Under "Secraching for meals", ensure the option "Admin's meal collection" is set to "Yes".
